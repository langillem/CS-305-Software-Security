Artemis Financial, a financial services company, required enhanced software security to address vulnerabilities, ensure secure communication, and protect data integrity. The project focused on implementing SHA-512 hashing, enforcing HTTPS with SSL/TLS, and using OWASP Dependency-Check to identify and mitigate risks from outdated libraries. A key improvement was refactoring the codebase by following the Separation of Concerns principle, making the application more secure and maintainable. Secure coding is essential to prevent cyberattacks, ensure regulatory compliance, and build customer trust. The vulnerability assessment revealed challenges such as identifying outdated dependencies, refactoring legacy code, and validating SSL/TLS certificates, but using automated scanning tools and industry best practices streamlined the process. Security layers, including transport security, authentication, and secure configuration, were implemented, while future assessments will incorporate static and dynamic analysis, penetration testing, and automated updates.

To verify functionality and security, functional testing, security scans, SSL/TLS validation, and log monitoring were performed post-refactoring. Best practices included cryptographic hashing, secure data storage, and enforcing security headers. This project demonstrated expertise in secure coding, vulnerability assessment, and software security testing aligned with industry standards such as OWASP, NIST, and ISO 27001. Future employers can see a well-documented security report, secure code implementations, and experience in refactoring legacy systems while improving security. These efforts ensure Artemis Financial's software remains protected, compliant, and resilient against evolving threats.
